# wordpress_installer

Tired of manually uploading ftp files to a server (because it's rocket science for most people...) and following the "Programming Motherf**r" cult, I quickly coded this simble bash script for installing a wordpress remotely, configuring the database in the progress.

For now it onlye install the latest version in english. I will try to be able to manage multiple versions/languages.

Also, path functionality is for now broken.

Will code for beer.
